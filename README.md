Brightfield Image Cellularity

This program loads brightfield images, segments them into cellular and acellular area and then calculates the percentage area covered by cells.
I will update this readme to be more detailed soon

N.B. This Git repo is a 'clean' version of a private repo, so sometimes I may have referred to files which do not exist. Removed files pertain to images 
which I don't have permission to make public
. This is also why there are no branches in the git history.

I will also be adding a code of conduct in the future
